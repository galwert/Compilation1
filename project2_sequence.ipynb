        "The second segment of the project involves a sequence labeling task, in which the goal is to label the tokens in a text. Many NLP tasks have this general form. Most famously is the task of _part-of-speech labeling_ as you explored in lab 2-4, where the tokens in a text are to be labeled with their part of speech (noun, verb, preposition, etc.). In this project segment, however, you'll use sequence labeling to implement a system for filling the slots in a template that is intended to describe the meaning of an ATIS query. For instance, the sentence \n",
        "\n",
        "    What's the earliest arriving flight between Boston and Washington DC?\n",
        "    \n",

        "        flight_mod: earliest arriving\n",
        "    \n",
        "You may wonder how this task is a sequence labeling task. We label each word in the source sentence with a tag taken from a set of tags that correspond to the slot-labels. For each slot-label, say `flight_mod`, there are two tags: `B-flight_mod` and `I-flight_mod`. These are used to mark the beginning (B) or interior (I) of a phrase that fills the given slot. In addition, there is a tag for other (O) words that are not used to fill any slot. (This technique is thus known as IOB encoding.) Thus the sample sentence would be labeled as follows:\n",

        "| Token   | Label    |\n",

        "| `earliest` | `B-flight_mod` |\n",
        "| `arriving` | `I-flight_mod` |\n",
        "| `flight` | `O` |\n",
        "| `between` | `O` |\n",
        "| `boston` | `B-fromloc.city_name` |\n",
        "| `and` | `O` |\n",
        "| `washington` | `B-toloc.city_name` |\n",
        "| `dc` | `B-toloc.state_code` |\n",
        "| `EOS` | `O` |\n",

        "> See below for information about the `BOS` and `EOS` tokens. \n",

        "The template itself is associated with the question type for the sentence, perhaps as recovered from the sentence in the last project segment.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this segment, you'll implement three methods for sequence labeling: a hidden Markov model (HMM) and two recurrent neural networks, a simple RNN and a long short-term memory network (LSTM). By the end of this homework, you should have grasped the pros and cons of the statistical and neural approaches.\n",

        "2. `compute_loss(self, logits, tags)`: Computes the loss for a batch by comparing `logits` of a batch returned by `forward` to `tags`, which stores the true tag ids for the batch. Thus `logits` is a tensor of size `max_length x batch_size x N`, and `tags` is a tensor of size `max_length x batch_size`. Note that the criterion functions in `torch` expect outputs of a certain shape, so you might need to perform some shape conversions.\n",

        "> You might find [`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html) from the last project segment useful. Note that if you use `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` then you should not use a softmax layer at the end since that's already absorbed into the loss function. Alternatively, you can use [`nn.LogSoftmax`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.LogSoftmax.html) as the final sublayer in the forward pass, but then you need to use [`nn.NLLLoss`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.NLLLoss.html), which does not contain its own softmax. We recommend the former, since working in log space is usually more numerically stable.\n",

        "3. `train_all(self, train_iter, val_iter, epochs=10, learning_rate=0.001)`: Trains the model on training data generated by the iterator `train_iter` and validation data `val_iter`.The `epochs` and `learning_rate` variables are the number of epochs (number of times to run through the training data) to run for and the learning rate for the optimizer, respectively. You can use the validation data to determine which model was the best one as the epocks go by. Notice that our code below assumes that during training the best model is stored so that `rnn_tagger.load_state_dict(rnn_tagger.best_model)` restores the parameters of the best model."

(Otter is used within project segment notebooks to synchronize distribution and solution code however.) **We will not run your notebook before grading it.** Instead, we ask that you submit the already freshly run notebook. The best method is to \"restart kernel and run all cells\", allowing time for all cells to be run to completion. You should submit your code to Gradescope at the code submission assignment at <https://rebrand.ly/project2-submit-code>.\n",
        "\n",
        "We also request that you **submit a PDF of the freshly run notebook**. The simplest method is to use \"Export notebook to PDF\", which will render the notebook to PDF via LaTeX. If that doesn't work, the method that seems to be most reliable is to export the notebook as HTML (if you are using Jupyter Notebook, you can do so using `File -> Print Preview`), open the HTML in a browser, and print it to a file. Then make sure to add the file to your git commit. Please name the file the same name as this notebook, but with a `.pdf` extension. (Conveniently, the methods just described will use that name by default.) You can then perform a git commit and push and submit the commit to Gradescope at <https://rebrand.ly/project2-submit-pdf>."
